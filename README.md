## Pendulum Project
The purpose of this project was to create a code to simulate data for the acceleration, velocity and position of a pendulum and then graph the data, create a code to collect
real world data using a microbit and then graph the theta vs time, acceleration vs time and find the period. The real world data was then compared to the simulation data.
## Instructions
Make sure Spyder is downloaded on computer in order to use matlibplot. Run `SimulationCode.py` on Spyder to obtain simulation data with graphs. To log data, connect
microbit to computer and flash `DataLoggingCode.py` onto microbit on Mu Connect microbit to pendulum and collect data. After collecting data,
make sure to connect microbit to computer without flashind data. Copy file from microbit onto computer. A sample file `Experiment1.txt` was included 
in the Github folder to test the code. To parse data and graph theta vs time, acceleration vs time, find peaks and period, run `ParsingData,Graphing,And CalculatingPeriod.py` on Spyder.
